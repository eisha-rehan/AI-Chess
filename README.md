# AI-Chess: 2-Player & AI-Driven Chess Game

## Overview

**AI-Chess** is a Chess game implementation offering two modes:

1. **2P-Chess (Two-Player Mode):** A traditional chess game where two human players can compete against each other.
2. **AI-Chess (Human vs AI Mode):** A game where a human plays against a computer opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. The AI is designed to evaluate and predict the best possible moves to maximize its chances of winning.

## Features

- **Human vs Human Mode:** A classic two-player chess game with all standard rules.
- **Human vs AI Mode:** Challenge an AI that uses advanced search algorithms (Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning) to evaluate moves and predict the optimal strategy to win.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** The AI analyzes potential moves and responses several steps ahead to select the best one.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Enhances the performance of the Minimax algorithm by pruning branches that are unlikely to influence the final decision, leading to faster move calculation.
